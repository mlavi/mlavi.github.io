      <title>What is a DevOps Advocate?</title>
      <link>https://mlavi.github.io/post/developer_relations_advocate/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is an Advocate and what is it in context of Developer Relations (DevRel)? After more than twenty years, I have returned to the realm of DevRel: so what has changed and what has remained the same?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DevOps in a Box</title>
      <link>https://mlavi.github.io/post/devops-in-a-box/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My long time fantasy has been to demonstrate an entire CI/CD pipeline with
continuous operations of applications to discuss behavior driven operations
and testing as monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call for this happened over and over at DevOpsDays to answer: how does one
learn DevOps, practice site reliability engineering, or have a full
application lifecycle environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#39;s create a minimal viable product &lt;a href=&#34;../devops-btd-pattern&#34;&gt;BTD scenario&lt;/a&gt;
of my &lt;a href=&#34;../devops-automation&#34;&gt;DevOps Automation&lt;/a&gt; system,
extend it to prefix Governance and suffix Management,
and then drive maturity to illustrate and discuss best practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Calm.io: a blog series recap!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From September 23, 2015 to May 26, 2016,
I took hiatus from my personal blog to explore, explain, and write a number
of DevOps articles for my employer on the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://calm.io/author/mark&#34;&gt;Calm.io blog&lt;/a&gt;. Nutanix acquired Calm.io and I
am still part of the Nutanix Calm team, but I&#39;m re-posting these articles on
my personal blog since the originals are no longer directly accessible.
I am also enhancing them to clarify language, add learnings,
and append significant developments as &lt;a href=&#34;#postscripts&#34;&gt;postscripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The DevOps Maturity Diagram</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The opening of
&lt;a href=&#34;../../post/calm.io-recap/calm.io-i-dream-of-devops-but-what-is-devops/&#34;&gt;my first Calm.io DevOps article&lt;/a&gt;
started with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share what Iâ€™ve learned on my journey to DevOps: it is a culturally
rendered term and it has a different meaning for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that article, I go on to define DevOps and explain the term. Let me share
my experience to easily chart the journey of progressive stages
to DevOps maturity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ten Steps from Pets to Cattle</title>
      <link>https://mlavi.github.io/post/ten_steps_from_pets_to_cattle/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 11:05:13 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mlavi.github.io/post/ten_steps_from_pets_to_cattle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we need DevOps when IT and Operations succeed in their responsibility
for security and uptime, using administrative tools to maintain, backup, and
restore those systems? Because the operations domain must be documented,
democratized, and distributed to achieve agility before Operations returns
to become a force multiplier instead of a keep the lights on organization.
Let me demonstrate that traditional values for long lived infrastructure and
their retroactive justification do not apply when progressing to a DevOps
mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a term that is not even six years old, DevOps remains a mysterious pursuit
for many software engineering organizations. Let me define DevOps to help you
understand and chart your own journey. &lt;em&gt;Hint:&lt;/em&gt; it is a cultural term!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wonderful accomplishments kicked-off my Infrastructure as Code project:
one should start with a map of the world before deciding where to focus,
but it is even better when you can optimize and render a new map in real-time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
