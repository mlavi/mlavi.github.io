      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we need DevOps when IT and Operations succeed in their responsibility
 for security and uptime, using administrative tools to maintain, backup, and
 restore those systems? Because the operations domain must be documented,
 democratized, and distributed to achieve agility before Operations returns
 to become a force multiplier instead of a keep the lights on organization.
 Let me demonstrate that traditional values for long lived infrastructure and
 their retroactive justification do not apply when progressing to a DevOps
 mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
