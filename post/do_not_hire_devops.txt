Do Not Hire DevOps: How to Build a DevOps Culture for Long-Term Success

A lightening talk: 20 slides, auto advancement every 15 seconds.

DevOps has no universal definition (by design) or prescription for success, so there is rampant abuse, hype, and failure by our practitioners and industry. I will give an honest and critical look at short-term failures and what it takes to build a DevOps culture for long-term success.

Who am I?

My career has been Dev+Ops since the beginning of the commercial Internet.

No Universal Definition of DevOps
=================================

- By design: ambiguity makes it a dynamic term
- No one and everyone is an authority, which leads to:

"Our powers made us special."
"Everyone's special, Dash."
"Which is another way of saying: no one is."

Rampant Abuse of the Term DevOps
================================

- Analysts
  - Next generation DevOps 2.0? B.S. Mode 2 cloud native only = DevOps
  - "X tools for a successful DevOps practice" clickbait to LinkedIn DevOps/AWS groups
  - Lots of stuff on devops.com :)
- Our industry
  - DevOps certification: WTF?
- Our practitioners
  - "I can tell you if I see it, but I can't tell you what it is."
  - "Let me do DevOps and I'll do whatever you desire" = false promise
  - Aspects and fragments which do not represent the journey:
    - A sysadmin who programs? a developer who gets production alerts?
    - DevOps === Continuous Deployment

There is so much hype written about DevOps that the term's ambiguity leads to abuse,
poor perception, and diminishing of our perceived impact.
We must have the courage to define DevOps, identify problems, and champion corrections.

My DevOps Definition
====================

"DevOps is the process of removing friction between the developer and customer value."

Use this as a lens to evaluate usage of the term, I could talk for hours on the implications
and how I arrived at this definition, but it covers all of the nuances I've encountered in my career.
It also is a business definition which aligns dev, test, ops with the organization mission.

One More Lens
=============

Pets versus Cattle
cite?

Pets = single point of failure, manual tending, long lived, embroiled in emotional values
Cattle = ephemeral fleet management and automation for SLAs, no remediation instead STONITH: shoot the other node in the head

With these two lenses, now we can analyze the problems and solutions.

[Image idea: Cattle]

Why Hire DevOps
===============

- We map the value chain of the business across fragmented
  domains, agendas, tools, and methods
  of dev, test, and ops teams
- We integrate these disparate systems and teams to enable
  continuous integration, delivery, and deployment thereby
  achieving business agility.

[Image/meme idea: Indistinguishable from magic?]

Interdisciplinary Talent is Hard to Find and Keep
=================================================

- We are expensive unicorns, regularly solicited by recruiters, so we can move on
- We leave when we:
  - encounter below market value pay, promotion, or responsibility to change culture
  - inherit too much debt without corrective management support

[Image idea: unicorn(s) with $ and rainbow poop]

DevOps Inherits Cultural Debt
=============================

Cause & Effect

- waterfall, agilefall work planning
  - date driven quality increases risk; anti-agile
- risk adverse culture
  - extensive procedures designed for "safety" is friction
  - heroics demanded out of business hours, weekends, vacations leads to burn out
- political decision making
  - unsupportive management blocks change champions
  - siloed teams and departments, each a pit of technical debt
  - manual hand offs is barrier to automation

DevOps Inherits Technical Debt
==============================

Cause & Effect

- no metrics in dev, test, or ops
    - no baseline, no visibility, no improvement
- pet architecture (SPoF)
    - monoliths with hard coded configuration fragments efforts, increases risk
- pet operations
    - change controls with outages
    - heroic acts in the middle of the night lead to burn out without a team to back you up
    - granular monitoring alerts leads to drowning in hysterysis and masking actual problems
- pet datacenters (SPoF)

When you use the lens, you will see pets everywhere. Including...

Pet DevOps
==========

- Cultural Debt fostered on DevOps team(s) is Not Agile.
  - When we accept all of the cultural and technical debt
  we become the bottleneck to agility
- Scaling DevOps efforts through headcount is a pet strategy
- If we are dishonest with our organizational change agent potential, we remain pets and will burn out
- When the DevOps team is an expensive pet bottleneck, we have an unsustainable business practice

DO NOT HIRE DevOps
==================

- Yes, I mean it.
- Sure, hiring DevOps can be a catalyst for change, but...
- Unless you have enlightened or agile minded management, you become pet DevOps and a bottleneck

Do I Mean It?
=============

- Yes: take DevOps out of your title at work (but not on LinkedIn) so people don't have you "do DevOps" for them.
- I really mean it, so what is the corollary?

We are all DevOps Cattle
========================

- We must evolve the culture to distribute DevOps across the organization: cattle
- We must transform dev, test, and Operations to take on a DevOps mindset
  - Find and align steak holders; the higher their responsibility, the better to support our efforts
  - Decompose DevOps monolith team into distributed DevOps across all teams
  - Technical debt epics, stories, and sprints
  - Refactor and interate towards automation
- Anything less represents a failure in agility and our potential impact on the business value delivery

Improve DevOps Practices
========================

- Culture Hacking
  - Bring case studies of how other engineering teams accomplish DevOps
  - Join and enhance your community: attend DevOpsDays, MeetUps, conferences
- Technology Hacking
  - Establish meaningful metrics to show improvement in dev, test, ops
  - Establish KPIs to show business impact

The journey to DevOps never ends: we must continue to pursue the state of the art!
