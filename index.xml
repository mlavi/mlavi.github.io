      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my 2020-1 holiday break, I decided my next personal project would be to rebuild my home infrastructure on containers. I&amp;rsquo;d been inspired by a recent discovery of &lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxserver.io&#34;&gt;LinuxServer.io&lt;/a&gt;, where open source projects are built and run as containers. While I have a burning desire to better my Kubernetes practice, not enough of the world delivers software as a Helm chart, so merely running everything as containers would be a good intermediate step. Let me share my first six steps with examples&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Democracy is a process: this past Wednesday was another test of United States democracy and a reckoning of our current administration&amp;rsquo;s dangerous tactics to stay in power. This has been another disheartening, depressing, embarrassing week in our enduring COVID-19 imposed lock down, but an older threat, the disease of poor thinking, was evident.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two factor authentication is an important safeguard for all of your accounts and it has proven itself by protecting one of the largest software engineering organizations in the world from breach. In order to easily control your safety and privacy without resorting to cloud service providers, let&amp;rsquo;s explore how to adopt dynamic passwords and avoid outsourcing your credentials!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A State of Emergency In the past three months, the soul of America has been laid bare in increasing amounts as we address our society&amp;rsquo;s response to our impaired health, economic, and political processes. There is a single crisis in all of this: our attitude as citizens to come together and solve any problem. America has been divided and exploited by those who profit by perpetuating the current system of inequalities of our society.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Version Control is an essential tool making your work reproducible and visible, which can unlock profound amplifying effects of your contributions. As operators
grow into developers, they can build toward state of the art &lt;a href=&#34;#gitops-the-convergence-of-devops&#34;&gt;GitOps&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is an Advocate and what is it in context of Developer Relations (DevRel)? After more than twenty years, I have returned to the realm of DevRel: so what has changed and what has remained the same?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My long time fantasy has been to demonstrate an entire CI/CD pipeline with
continuous operations of applications to discuss behavior driven operations
and testing as monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call for this happened over and over at DevOpsDays to answer: how does one
learn DevOps, practice site reliability engineering, or have a full
application lifecycle environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s create a minimal viable product &lt;a href=&#34;../devops-btd-pattern&#34;&gt;BTD scenario&lt;/a&gt;
of my &lt;a href=&#34;../devops-automation&#34;&gt;DevOps Automation&lt;/a&gt; system,
extend it to prefix Governance and suffix Management,
and then drive maturity to illustrate and discuss best practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you new to automation, it can be overwhelming on first
exposure to handle every link in the chain to launch your first Nutanix Calm blueprint. Many Calm Marketplace blueprints leverage Linux, cloud-init, and SSH keypairs to enable security best-practices for composable infrastructure as code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Calm.io: a blog series recap!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From September 23, 2015 to May 26, 2016,
I took hiatus from my personal blog to explore, explain, and write a number
of DevOps articles for my employer on the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://calm.io/author/mark&#34;&gt;Calm.io blog&lt;/a&gt;. Nutanix acquired Calm.io and I
am still part of the Nutanix Calm team, but I&amp;rsquo;m re-posting these articles on
my personal blog since the originals are no longer directly accessible.
I am also enhancing them to clarify language, add learnings,
and append significant developments as &lt;a href=&#34;#postscripts&#34;&gt;postscripts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The opening of
&lt;a href=&#34;./post/calm.io-recap/calm.io-i-dream-of-devops-but-what-is-devops/&#34;&gt;my first Calm.io DevOps article&lt;/a&gt;
started with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share what Iâ€™ve learned on my journey to DevOps: it is a culturally
rendered term and it has a different meaning for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that article, I go on to define DevOps and explain the term. Let me share
my experience to easily chart the journey of progressive stages
to DevOps maturity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ten Steps from Pets to Cattle</title>
      <link>https://mlavi.github.io/post/ten_steps_from_pets_to_cattle/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2017 11:05:13 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mlavi.github.io/post/ten_steps_from_pets_to_cattle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we need DevOps when IT and Operations succeed in their responsibility
for security and uptime, using administrative tools to maintain, backup, and
restore those systems? Because the operations domain must be documented,
democratized, and distributed to achieve agility before Operations returns
to become a force multiplier instead of a keep the lights on organization.
Let me demonstrate that traditional values for long lived infrastructure and
their retroactive justification do not apply when progressing to a DevOps
mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new breed of operating systems adopt declarative configuration management for

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In these early years of containers, &amp;ldquo;heavy containers&amp;rdquo; represent a typical approach which
resembles virtual machines, includes the operating system user land, and desires configuration
management. Does this starting point represent the opposite of container promise and the journey
to immutable infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
